# CodexBar for iOS

Native iOS companion app for CodexBar. This repo starts from the Windows app's provider model and refresh-loop concepts, but uses SwiftUI and iOS-native storage, networking, and background behavior.

The Windows reference implementation is checked out beside this repo at:

## Current Scope

- SwiftUI dashboard with account-scoped usage cards for Codex, GitHub Copilot,
  Claude, Cursor, OpenRouter, OpenCode Go + Zen, Moonshot (Kimi), Greptile,
  and Google Gemini
- Live provider adapters and settings for enabling accounts, choosing supported
  authentication methods, labeling accounts, and storing credentials in Keychain
- Usage history and charts, configurable usage alerts, and home-screen and
  lock-screen widgets
- Read-only Greptile review-activity tracking through an organization API key,
  with completed reviews kept distinct from pull requests and billing credits
- Read-only consumer Gemini Apps usage tracking through user-supplied Google
  session credentials, with separate 5-hour and weekly meters and reset times
- An embedded watchOS companion with a live, read-only dashboard that mirrors
  presentation-ready account metrics, visualization choices, ordering, and
  freshness from iPhone; provider setup, credentials, and provider networking
  remain iPhone-only
- Demo data limited to previews, smoke tests, widget galleries, and screenshots
- Simulator unit tests spanning configuration and authentication, provider
  parsing and networking, dashboard and settings, widgets, history, and alerts,
  plus watchOS foundation tests and a SwiftPM smoke harness; see
  [Build and Test](AGENTS.md#build-and-test)

## Requirements

- Xcode 16 or later
- iOS 17 or later
- watchOS 10 or later for the companion app

## GitHub Copilot Sign-In

CodexBar bundles the public OAuth client ID and client secret used by
Copilot CLI-compatible clients. Static credentials shipped in an app cannot be
kept confidential: these values identify the OAuth application, but they do not
provide access to a GitHub account. Browser sign-in still requires the user to
authorize access, uses PKCE to protect the authorization-code exchange, and
stores the resulting account tokens in the iOS Keychain.

Developers can replace the bundled values in debug builds with the
`CODEXBAR_COPILOT_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and
`CODEXBAR_COPILOT_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. Release builds
ignore process-environment overrides and use values from the app bundle or the
documented defaults in `CopilotWebAuthService.swift`.

## Google Gemini Session Credentials

Google does not currently publish an OAuth scope or API for the consumer Gemini
Apps usage meters. CodexBar therefore accepts a Cookie header copied from a
signed-in `gemini.google.com` session. It extracts only `__Secure-1PSID` and the
optional rotating `__Secure-1PSIDTS` value, discards every other pasted cookie,
and stores the selected values in iOS Keychain.

Gemini session credentials are more sensitive than an API key and may grant
broader access to the Google account. CodexBar sends them only to
`gemini.google.com`, rejects cross-origin redirects, and performs read-only
requests to Gemini's Usage page. This integration depends on an undocumented
web contract and will fail closed if the page tokens or quota response change.

## Open Locally

```bash
open CodexBarIOS.xcodeproj
```

The project includes shared `CodexBarWatch` and `CodexBarWatchTests` schemes.
The watch source is isolated under `CodexBarWatch/`; it intentionally does not
compile the iOS authentication, notification, widget, or UIKit-dependent code.
Use the documented simulator commands in
[Build and Test](AGENTS.md#build-and-test) to build and test the watch targets.

## Mutation Testing

A focused, non-blocking mutation-testing pilot covers deterministic dashboard
sorting and App Review prompt policy logic. See
[MUTATION-TESTING.md](MUTATION-TESTING.md) for the pinned tool, baseline
findings, survivor triage, and reproducible local command.

## Reference Repo

The current Windows app is a C# / WPF / .NET 9 system tray app with shared provider logic in `src/CodexBar.Core`. The iOS implementation should port behavior from there deliberately instead of sharing project structure directly.
